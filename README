HPC concerned C/C++ codes are presented.

- ./cuda/matrix_multi.cu:
  Three (3) matrix multiplication algorithms were implemented, and performance was compared.
  1. Intuitive implementation of matrix multiplication with cuda.
  2. Improved implementation of matrix multiplication with cuda, using shared memory and tiling.
  3. Call of cuBlas function cublasSgemm
